                rating=4.5,
                summary=''' Java Programming Concepts
1. Syntax and Structure
Class: The fundamental building block in Java. It is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Method: A block of code within a class that performs a specific task.
Main Method: The entry point for any Java application, defined as public static void main(String[] args).
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and Objects:
Class: Defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class can have.
Object: An instance of a class.
Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability.
Polymorphism: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
Encapsulation: Bundles the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricts access to some of the object's components.
Abstraction: Hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary features of an object.
3. Basic Data Types
Primitive Types: The most basic data types provided by Java. Examples include:
int: Represents an integer value.
char: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.
double: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating point.
boolean: Represents a true or false value.
Non-Primitive Types: Also known as reference types, they refer to objects. Examples include:
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Array: A collection of variables of the same type.
Classes: User-defined data types.
4. Control Structures
Conditional Statements: Allow the program to make decisions based on conditions.
if, else if, else: Execute different blocks of code based on boolean conditions.
switch: Select one of many code blocks to execute.
Loops: Allow the execution of a block of code multiple times.
for: Iterates over a range of values.
while: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.
do-while: Similar to while but the block of code executes at least once.
5. Standard Libraries
Java Standard Library: Provides a wide array of classes and methods to perform various tasks.
Common Packages:
java.lang: Contains fundamental classes like String, Math, and System.
java.util: Contains utility classes such as collections framework classes (ArrayList, HashMap).
java.io: Provides classes for input and output through data streams, serialization, and the file system.
Key Theoretical Concepts
Class and Object Example
Class Definition: A class encapsulates data for the object. It has fields (attributes) and methods (functions).
Object Instantiation: Creating an object from a class involves using the new keyword.
Encapsulation
Achieved by making fields private and providing public getter and setter methods.
Promotes data hiding and ensures that the object's data is accessed only through defined methods.
Inheritance
Allows the creation of a new class that inherits the properties and methods of an existing class.
Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Polymorphism
Method Overloading: Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
Method Overriding: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
